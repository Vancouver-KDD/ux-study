## 01. project background
  why you're doing this research. Why is the project background an important part of your research plan
  01. Identify the signals that indicated research was necessary. 

  02. Describe any previous research that has been conducted or solutions that have been tried. 
  03. List insights the research will generate. 

how the insights will be used and what decisions will be made based on those insights. 
#### keep the project background concise  
<br/><br/>
## 02. research goals 
- foundational research. Design research.<br/>
goal of design research would be to learn how you should build the app and what features it will need in order to solve the user's problem.
- post-launch research <br/>
understand if the app we designed attracts and retains regular users
<br/><br/>
## 03. research questions
actionable / specific and not too broad / neutrally phrased 
-  Quantitative research focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring 
-    Qualitative research focuses on observations about why and how things happen
<br/><br/>
## 04. KPIs key performance indicators
  *  time on task
  *  use of navigation versus search
  *  user error rates <kbd> ex) click on the wrong icon when trying to check out their cart. 
  *  drop-off rates
  *  conversion rates  <kbd> the percentage of users that actually made a purchase
  *  system usability scale, or SUS. <kbd> ex)  "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree" scale. 
 <br/><br/>
## 05. Methodology
- the methodology informs your stakeholders of what will happen during the study, how long the study is, and where it will take place. 
- detailing your methodology will give stakeholders more confidence in your study's results, because they can see all of the steps. This makes it more likely they'll act on your suggestions. 
- the methodology provides the details that other researchers need to repeat the exact same study in the future.

<br/><br/>
## 06.Participants
  The types of participants you select should be based on your research goals.
  - characteristics <kbd>participants helps you avoid sample bias
  - screener survey  <kbd> ask potential participants a series of questions to see if they meet your desired characteristics.
  - incentive <kbd>  thank participants for their time and feedback
  
 #### recruit participants who use the assistive technologies you want to involve in your study.
    * Screen readers
    * Closed captions
    * Switch devices
    * Keyboard-only navigation
    * Magnification devices or magnified screens
    * Any other assistive technologies that will provide insights about your UX design
  
 #### Assistive technology for participants with disabilities
 A permanent disability/ A temporary impairment / A situational challenge

  <b>most common assistive technology ATs</b><br/>
 A screen reader /  A switch / Closed captioning and speech-to-text / Reminder alarms / Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices

<br/><br/>
  
## 07.  Script
- any instructions and so we keep language consistent for each participant. 
- Prepare ahead of time to avoid having to redo the study.   
####  tips for writing interview questions.  
01. First and foremost, use the same set of questions for each interview.
02. Second, ask open-ended questions. <kbd> "How did you feel about...?" and "What bothered you about...?"
03. encourage elaboration.  <kbd> "Tell me more about that" to encourage elaboration. 
04. ask the same question from different angles. <kbd> "How often do you walk your dog?" at the start of the interview, then, "How many times a week does your dog need a walk?" in the middle of the interview. 
05. don't mention other users
06. don't ask leading questions

# Make privacy a part of UX practices
 It's just the right thing to do. For ethical reasons, when conducting research we should always act with integrity, and that includes protecting users' privacy.
  
    *  privacy laws and ethics
    *  risk of hacking
    *  protecting your company's brand.
 
### privacy concerns
    *  vulnerable populations : minors, people with disabilities, people who are elderly, people who are currently incarcerated, and individuals that are members of the LGBTQ IA plus community

### safety of research data
    *  data recording.
    *  data storage
    *  data retention
### you should have an agreement in place with the company you work for that lays out who keeps the research data if you leave the company 
  
  
### tools you can use to maintain privacy  
  01. de-identification : removing any identifying information
  02. non-disclosure agreement or an NDA : compensate you for the loss 
## UX research process
### 1. plan the study
###### outlining the background for the project, set goals for your research, and write down the questions

### 2. conduct the research, 
###### usability study
### 3. analyze and synthesize the results 
######  Look for patterns in the quantitative data and explore trends in the qualitative data from participants' answers to interview questions.

### 4. share and promote the insights.
###### presentation should include the method you use to conduct your research, the data you collected, the conclusions you reached based on that data, and your recommendations for acting on those conclusions. The stronger the connection between your research conclusions and your recommendations, the more likely it is that your stakeholders will take the actions you've proposed.
