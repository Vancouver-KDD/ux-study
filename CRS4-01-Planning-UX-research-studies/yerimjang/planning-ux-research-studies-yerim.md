# Planning UX Research Studies
### Understand the UX research process
###### Research study
- A step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic context to the design process.
###### Usability study
- A research method that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design.
###### Project stakeholders
- People who are involved in the project or who will be impacted by its results.
###### Research presentation
- Methods
- Data
- Conclusions
- Recommendations

##### Language and communication in UX research
###### Best practices for communication in UX research
- Be equitable
- Be inclusive
- Be honest
- Be neutral
- Be a team player
###### Language and communication matter
- The language you use while conducting research directly affects the language your participants use.
###### Consider word choices
- Keep in mind that some languages and language varieties express the same concepts in different ways.
- “Let’s **walk** through the details of the study.” vs “Let’s **go** through the details of the study.”
###### Keep the context in mind
- Different communities have different ways of interacting with others in various situations, so it’s important to be aware of those cultural differences.

### Build a UX research plan
##### Elements of a UX research plan
1. Project Background
    - We're creating a new app to help people find and schedule dog walkers. We need to find out if the main user experience, finding and scheduling a dog walker, is easy for users to complete.
2. Research Goals
3. Research Questions
    - How long does it take a user to find and book a dog walker in the app?
    - What can we learn from the user flow, or the steps that users take, to book a dog walker?
4. Key Performance Indicators (KIPs)
    - Percentage of users who book a dog walker
5. Methodology
    - Conduct a survey of prospective users
    - Use a spreadsheet and identify trends
6. Participants
    - Dog owners with full-time jobs and who go out for activities more than once a week
7. Script

##### Importance of project background
- Gets the team on the same page at the beginning of study
- Shows you understand why you're doing this research
- Promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and insights

##### How to write the project background
- Identify the signals that indicated research was necessary
- Describe any previous research
- List insights the research will generate

##### Insight
- An observation about people that helps you understand the user or their needs from a new perspective

##### Foundational research goal
- Understand why or if you should build the product

##### Design research goal
- Understand how to build the product

##### Post-launch research goal
- Understand if the product worked as expected

##### How to write research questions
- Actionable
- Specific
- Avoid leading questions

##### Quantitative research
- Focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring

##### Qualitative research
- Focuses on observations about why and how things happen

##### Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Critical measures of progress toward an end goal
  - Time on task
    - How long it takes for a user to complete a task
  - Use of navigation vs. search
    - The number of people who use a website or app's navigation compared to the number of people who use the search functionality.
  - User error rates
    - Indicate the parts of a design that cause users to make errors
  - Drop-off rates
    - How many users abandon the experience
  - Conversion rates
    - Measures the percentage of users who complete a desired action
  - System Usability Scale (SUS)
    - A questionnaire to measure the usability of your designs
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS)
    - A measure of how loyal users will be to your product or service: Promoters, Passives, Detractors

##### Methodology
- The steps you take to conduct your research

##### Participants
- Characteristics
- Screener survey
- Incentive
- Diverse perspectives and abilities

##### Recruit a diverse participant pool
- Existing user base
- Online
- Hallway testing
- Incentives

##### Tips for writing a usability script
- Use the same set of questions for each interview
- Ask open-ended questions
- Encourage elaboration
- Ask the same question from different angles
- Don't mention other users
- Don't ask leading questions

### Respect user data and privacy
##### Importance of keeping user data private
- It's the right thing to do
- Privacy laws and ethics
- Risk of hacking
- Protecting your company's brand

##### Privacy and security practices
- Be transparent about data collection
- Only collect user data that's absolutely essential
- Get active consent
- Detail how you'll use participants' info and protect privacy
- Allow users to withdraw
- Inform users of who will have access to their data
- Explain how you plan to store and delete users' data

###### Vulnerable populations
- Groups of people who have limited ability to provide their consent of have special privacy concerns

###### Data recording
- Document you study and results in a way that's consistent with UX research standards

###### Data storage
- Make sure your data is held in a way that's safe from hacking and physical damage

###### Data retention
- How long you and your company hold on to research data

###### De-identification
- Removing any identifying information from a user's data that you collect during a study

###### Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
- A contract that gives one party legal protection against another party stealing their ideas
