# Make insights from observations
In just four steps, we can turn the observations from our research into actionable insights.
1. gather all of the data from our usability study in one place.
2. Organize the data. 
3. Find themes in the data.
4. come up with insights for each theme

## Gather and organize data

### Method #01 : affinity diagram (grouping)
synthesizing that organizes data into groups with common themes or relationships.

#### Gather and organize data (find themes)
After creating your affinity diagram, take some time to observe which sticky notes have been grouped together into categories. Areas of the affinity diagram with multiple sticky notes usually represent a pattern and later each pattern becomes a theme.

#### Find patterns and themes in data

#### strong insights
Next, we'll learn how to come up with insights based on the themes you identify
01.  grounded in real data
02. answer the research questions you listed in your research plan.
03. easy to understand.
04. increase empathy for the user experience.
05.  inspire direct action.  
          ex:  "Users want to book a dog walker on a scheduled basis instead of making a one-time reservation," 
          
    * UXR  "Fall in love with the problem," is probing into why that the issue is,
    * UXD "love with the solution itself" take that insight and canfix the problem.

##### Pattern identification - Gmail labels 
1. It was observed that 4 out of 5 subjects had trouble finding the 3 dots sub-menu .
   - This means that the 3 dots sub-menu is difficult to find for almost all users.
2. It was observed that 3 out of 5 subjects had a hard time knowing what to do first to create a label .
   - This means that for most users, it’s not immediately clear how to create a new label .
3. It was observed that 3 out of 5 subjects saw a use for labels . 
   - This means that labels are useful for most people, but not an overwhelming majority .
4. It was observed that 3 out of 5 subjects were confused by the word “nest” when adding a sub label .
   - This means that not everyone is familiar with the term “nesting” or this specific use .
5. It was observed that 3 out of 5 subjects had trouble changing the color of the “Shopping” label .
   - This means that most users were unsure how to change

##### INSIGHTS
1. Based on the theme that: for most users, it’s not immediately clear how to create a new label, 
   - an insight is: users need better cues for what steps are required to create a label.
2. Based on the theme that: the 3 dot sub-menu is difficult to find for almost all users, 
   - an insight is: users need a more intuitive way to access label settings.
3. Based on the theme that: labels are useful for most people, but not an overwhelming majority, 
   - an insight is: users need more information about the potential value of using Gmail labels.
4. Based on the theme that: not everyone is familiar with the term “nesting” or this specific use, 
   - an insight is: use accessible language (avoid jargon) when explaining uses for the Gmail labels feature.
5. Based on the theme that: most users were unsure how to change the color of a label, 
   - an insight is: users need better cues for what steps are required to change the color of a label.
