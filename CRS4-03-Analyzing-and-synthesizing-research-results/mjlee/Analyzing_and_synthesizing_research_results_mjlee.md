# Make insights from observations
In just four steps, we can turn the observations from our research into actionable insights.
1. gather all of the data from our usability study in one place.
2. Organize the data. 
3. Find themes in the data.
4. come up with insights for each theme

## Gather and organize data

### Method #01 : affinity diagram (grouping)
synthesizing that organizes data into groups with common themes or relationships.

#### Gather and organize data (find themes)
After creating your affinity diagram, take some time to observe which sticky notes have been grouped together into categories. Areas of the affinity diagram with multiple sticky notes usually represent a pattern and later each pattern becomes a theme.

#### Find patterns and themes in data

#### strong insights
Next, we'll learn how to come up with insights based on the themes you identify
01.  grounded in real data
02. answer the research questions you listed in your research plan.
03. easy to understand.
04. increase empathy for the user experience.
05.  inspire direct action.  
          ex:  "Users want to book a dog walker on a scheduled basis instead of making a one-time reservation," 
          
    * UXR  "Fall in love with the problem," is probing into why that the issue is,
    * UXD "love with the solution itself" take that insight and canfix the problem.
