# Conduct usability study
A usability study is a research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a design. 

## moderated 
 have a person, known as a moderator, guide participants through the study in real time. 


| ADVANTAGE     | DISADVANTAGE  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| - Build rapport. <br>- Observe firsthand.<br>- Provide live guidance.<br>- Explain the user journey. <br>- Control the conversation. <br>- Make language adjustments.<br>- Gain clarification.| - Influence or bias. <br>- Self-identification. <br>- Participant pool. <br>- Difficult scheduling. <br>- Reliable internet required. <br>- High cost. |



## unmoderated 
 have participants test the prototypes without human guidance. 

| ADVANTAGE     | DISADVANTAGE  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| - Natural product interactions. <br>- More participants. <br>- Easier scheduling.<br>- Inexpensive. <br>- More privacy. <br>- Simple user journeys.|- No live follow-ups.<br>- Potential distractions. <br>- Possible privacy breaches.         <br>- Inaccessibility.<br>- More data to analyze. <br>- Simple user journeys only.|

 ## usability study best practices
1. Get comfortable : build a rapport with participants
2. Put people first : use people-first language/  marginalized communities
3. Don't skip the paperwork : nondisclosure agreement (NDA) / allow their session to be recorded.
4. Communicate clearly : Explain the focus of the study / If you’re ever unsure about the feedback participants are sharing, try to summarize their ideas for confirmation. Repeat back what you think the participant means, and encourage them to correct or confirm the statement.
6. Ask the right questions
    - Use the same set of questions with each participant.
    - Ask open-ended questions. 
    - Encourage elaboration. 
    - Ask the same question from different angles.
    - Don’t mention other participants. 
    - Don’t ask leading questions. 


## Identify biases when interviewing usability study participants
#### Confirmation bias 
- Recruit an appropriate sample size. 
- It’s not about your beliefs.
#### Leading questions 
- Encourage participants to think aloud. 
- Limit your responses. 
#### Friendliness bias 
- Honesty is the best policy.
- Stay consistently engaged.
#### Social desirability bias 
- Conduct 1:1 interviews. 
- Ensure confidentiality.

#### Hawthorne effect 
people tend to act differently when they know they’re being watched. 
- Create a non-threatening environment. 
- Establish rapport.
