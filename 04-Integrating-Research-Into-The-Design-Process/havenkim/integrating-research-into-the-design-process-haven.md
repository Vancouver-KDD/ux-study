# Understand the role of research in design

## User Research

Focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback

In product development life cycle, user research is continuous part happening before design, during design, after design.

### Before design : Foundational research (aka. Strategic research, generic research)

Happens during the brainstorm stage to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions.

By doing this research phase, answers the questions

- What should we build?
- What are the user's problems?
- How can we solve those problems?
- Am I aware of my own biases, and *am I able to filter them as I do research?*

This research phase includes talking with users, identifying their pain points.

#### Research methods for conducting foundational research**

- Interviews: A research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. You’ll often conduct interviews of your target users themselves.

- Surveys: An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.

- Focus groups: A small group of people whose reactions are studied. For example, your focus group might bring together eight users to discuss their perspectives about new features in your design. A focus group is usually run by a moderator who guides the group on a certain topic of conversation.

- Competitive audit: An overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. You'll conduct your own competitive audit later in the course, so you will understand this research method well!

- Field studies: Research activities that take place in the user's context or personal environment, rather than in an office or lab.

- Diary studies: A research method used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. Often, a user will log, or diary, about their daily activities and provide information about their behaviors and needs, which can help inform your designs.

### During design : Design research (aka. Tactical research)

Happens during the design stage to help inform your designs, to fit the needs of users, and to reduce risk. *Each time you create a new version* of your design, *new research should be done* to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed.

By doing this research phase, answers this question

- How should we build it?

But the amount of design research will vary depending on where you work and what you're building. Mostly it's about **Usability Study**.

We would ask users these kind of questions about the prototype

- How was your experience using the prototype today?
- How easy or difficult was it to use? why?

This phase is for finding out `how the product should be built?`

#### Research methods for conducting design research**

- A/B testing: A research method that evaluates and compares two different aspects of a product to discover which of them is most effective. For example, you might have users evaluate two layouts for the homepage of your app to find out which layout is more effective.

- Cafe or guerrilla studies: A research method where user feedback is gathered by taking a design or prototype into the public domain and asking passersby for their thoughts. For example, you might sit in a local coffee shop and ask customers if they would be willing to test your app design for a couple of minutes and provide feedback.

- Card sorting: A research method that instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them. This type of research is largely used to figure out the information architecture of your project, which we’ll discuss in the next course of the program — Course 3: Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Designs.

- Intercepts: A research method that gathers on-site feedback from users as they engage in the activities being researched. Intercepts are often conducted in the field, so this type of research is often considered a subset of field research. An intercept study can provide quick, high-level feedback.

### After design : Post-launch research

Evaluate how the launch features meeting the needs of users

Answers...

- Did we succeed?

#### Research methods for conducting post launch research**

- A/B testing

- Usability studies

- Surveys

- Logs analysis: A research method used to evaluate recordings of users while they interact with your design, tools, etc.

### User researcher qualilties

Having those traits will improve the output of research.

- Empathy: Able to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation.
- Pragmatism : Focused on reaching goals
- Collaboration : Can work with a range of people, personalities, and work styles.

## Research methods

There are two ways to categorize research, "**Who conducts** the research" and "The **type of data** collected".

### Who conducts the research?

- Primary research
  - You conduct yourself.
  - Direct interactions with users are considered primary research.
    - Interviews, surveys, usability studies.

- Secondary research
  - Someone else already has conducted research and they put everything together.
  - Books, articles, journals.

### The Types of data collected

- Qualitative research : About "Why"
  - Collected through observations and conversations.
  - Based on understanding users' needs and aims to answer questions like
    - Why? How did this happen?

- Quantitative research : About "What"
  - Collecetd by counting or measuring.
  - Based on numerical data that's often collected from large-scale surveys. Aims to answer questions like
    - How many? How much?

### Pros and cons of Primary research methods

- Interview [Article from Nielsen Normal Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/)
  - For *collecting in-depth information* on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings.
  - Quantitative Form
    - Includes only *close-ended questions*, require only "Yes" or "No" or multiple choice options.
  - Qualitative Form
    - Includes *open-ended questions* that participants should provide more details to answer.
  - Best practice is to conduct *at least five user interviews* during the research.

  Benefits
  - Understand what users think and why.
  - Ask follow up questions in real-time.
  - Adjust questions or refocus the discussion point based on users' answers.

  Drawbacks
  - Take time and money (rent a space, bring them in, etc.)
  - Small sample size due to time and money contraints
  - *Group interviews could have *bandwagon effect* (go along with the group's opinion instead of thinking creatively)

- Surveys [Article from usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/online-surveys.html)
  - To understanmd what most people think about a product.
  - It is a great way to measure the success and effectiveness of the product, during development and after release.
  - Quantitative Form
    - Generate numerical and statistical data
  - Qualitative Form
    - Let participants clarify their survey responses.

  Benefits
  - Larger sample size
  - Gather results and insights quickly.
  - Inexpensive because they don't take as much time for participants to complete, and they can be done remotely

  Drawbacks
  - No in-depth feedback. Most questions will have responses drawn from a set of multiple-choice answers.
  - Some type of research questions doesn't work in a survey format.
  - Doesn't allow personalization.

- Usability studies [Article from Nielsen Normal Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/)
  - To evaluate a product by testing it on users.
  - It helps demonstrate if a prodcuct is on the right track or if the design needs to be adjusted.
  - Could be conducted in person and online, recording usability test sessions for referencing the user data is a good idea.
  - Quantitative Form
    - To understand participants' impressions of the product.
  - Qualitative Form
    - Observing how participants interact with the product.
    - Can generate more personal insioghts by assessing the behavior of users.

  Benefits
  - First-hand user interaction
  - Challenge our assumptions by demonstrating a completely different result than we expected.
  - In-depth feedback from users.

  Drawbacks
  - Only measures how easy a product is to use
  - Expensive, especially if it's conducted in person.
  - There can be differences between a "Controlled" usability study in lab VS how a user experience the product in their real life.

- Secondary research [Article from formplus](https://www.formpl.us/blog/secondary-research)
  - Can be done in any phase of designing. Usually happens even before the start of the product development cycle.
  - Even though it is not a direct result of the product but it might lay a foundation of the product or supplement the findings from the primary research to reiterate or strengthen your conclusions.

  Benefits
  - Saves time and money because it has been already done.
  - Immediately accessible by online research and publications.
  - Good supplement to findings from the primary research

  Drawbacks
  - No first-hand user interaction
  - No specific user feedback
  - It can be misleading and generalizing if not done appropriately

## Biases in UX Research

Bias - Favoring or having prejudice against something based on limited information

### Confirmation bias

Occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have. Because you think you already have the answer, you are drawn to information that confirms your beliefs and preconceptions.

To overcome

- Ask open-ended questions when conducting interviews.
- Actively listen, not guiding users to answer what you want.
- Include a large sample of users, and also try not to include people who fit in preconception.

### False consensus bias

The assumption that others will think the same way as you do. Overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design. It makes you th feel anyone who doesn't agree with you is abnormal.

If you find a few people who do align with your beliefs and assuming they represent the entire community is a false consensus.

To overcome

- Identifying and articulating the assumptions.
- Survey large groups of poeple.

### Recency bias & Primacy bias

Recency : The last thing you heard in an interview, conversation, or similar setting because it's the most recent, they affect you to have a bias.

Primacy : You remember the first participant most strongly because they gave you very strong impression.

To overcome

- Take detailed notes or recordings for each interview or conversation you have.
- Consistency makes it easier to compare and contrast over time.

### Implicit (unconscious) bias

The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge.

When we only interview poeple within a limited set if identity profiles, such as age, race, gender, socioeconomic status and ability.

But everybody has implicit biases.

To overcome

- Reflect on our own behaviors
- Ask others to point out our implicit biases.

### Sunk cost fallacy

The deeper we get into a product we've invested in, the harder it is to change course.

"Sunk cost" refers to the time we've already spent or sunk into a project or activity.

To overcome

- Break down the project into smaller phases
- Outline points where you can decide whether to continue or stop.

It allows you to go back based on new insights before the project gets too far along.

### Practice to prevent biases

#### Choose words carefully

If you choose words that lead the users' question in a way of pleasing your result, it causes **Framing effect**.

It's very critical in usability studies.

"Do you like or dislike the improved layout of these buttons" => "Explain how you feel about the layout of the buttons"

#### Foster independent thinking

To avoid *Bandwagon effect*, ask participants to write down or record their thoughts before discussing as a group.

#### Avoid specific language

You have your preconception and a hypothesis. And you are trying to get answers and prove yourself you are right.

This confirmation bias particularly prevalent in online surveys.

For example, you prepared a question, "How do you use our product?". But you made the survey to have only 4 answers without "Others" option, which is forcing users to choose one of them.

You will end up with false information that skews research data nad potentially provides incorrect evidence for a hypothesis you already had.

That answer could be better with reframed answer at scale of 1 to 10 rating scores.

#### Limit the guidance you give users

False consensus happens because you think they think as you do.

It prevalents in usability test. It is very important to let users follow their own paths through the product but you start interruopting their testing and it will deprive you of useful data for understanding how to improve user design and interaction.

It's a lot better to let them narrate or break down their thoughts in journey to help you understand their thinking process.

#### Consider users' tone and body language

It leads to implicit biases, which are based on the collection of attitudes and stereotypes you associate with people without your conscious knowledge, it’s important to clarify when you think you’re getting mixed signals from a participant.

It is always important to make sure participants are comfortable sharing their thoughts with you. Before the study begins, start with a light conversations or icebreaker to let them feel ease and reduce awkwardness throughout the study.

Because these kinds of tone or body languages could lead into incorrect feedback from users. They might be more defensive or aggressive in a certain circumstances.

#### Be careful of your own body language and reactions

Vice versa, it makes participants to have different mood than they have. Social desirability bias can happen when a participant answers a question based on what they think you want to hear.

#### Plan the research effectively

Availability bias occurs when you rush the user recruitment process or skip screener questions to attract a bigger pool of users, even if they doin't fit the qualifications or characteristics that you've already determinded are present in your ideal user.

#### Remain open minded

Primacy bias and Recency bias happen if you get impressed by the first participant or affected a lot by the last participant. Always stay open minded to avoid throughout experience of entire reseach process.
