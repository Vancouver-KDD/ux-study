### User Research Methods
- Who conducts
	- Primary research
		- - Interviews
			- open-ended questions
			- Benefits - understand what users think and why
			- Drawbacks - take time and money, small size
		- Surveys
			- Benefits - larger sample size, fast, inexpensive
			- Drawbacks - no in-depth feedback
		- Usability study
			- prototypes
			- KPIs
			- Benefits - firsthand user interaction, challenge our assumptions, in-depth feedback
			- Drawbacks - only measure how easy a product is to use, expensive, difference lab vs real life
	- Secondary research
		- know facts, stats...
		- Benefits - saves time and money, accessible, backs up primary research
		- Drawbacks - no first-hand user interaction, no specific user feedback
- Type of data collected
	- Quantitative research
