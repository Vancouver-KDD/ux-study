#### IDEATION is focusd on coming up with a lot of ideas

- Let users test the idea and they might find the best ideas.

####  Understanding the business needs behind a design
Design can help facilitate a conversation between a business and its users.

### how to use findings from your competitive audit to brainstorm new ideas?
Your goal is to walk away from this brainstorm with a list of ideas that help your product stand out from the competition.
##### Lots of ideas >  sorting > group similar ideas to uncover patterns > few ideas will naturally rise to the top
