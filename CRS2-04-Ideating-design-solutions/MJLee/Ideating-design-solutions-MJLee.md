2. Desirable: Does it solve the user problem you're focusing on? 
3. Viable: Is it financially beneficial for the business? <br/>https://designthinking.ideo.com/

#### IDEATION is focusd on coming up with a lot of ideas
- ideas will be narrowed down when you have to think about constraints.

- Let users test the idea and they might find the best ideas.

####  Understanding the business needs behind a design
Design can help facilitate a conversation between a business and its users.
- Voice and tone have a huge impact on a user's experience with a product
