2. Desirable: Does it solve the user problem you're focusing on? 
3. Viable: Is it financially beneficial for the business? <br/>https://designthinking.ideo.com/

#### IDEATION is focusd on coming up with a lot of ideas
- ideas will be narrowed down when you have to think about constraints.
- we need to come up with ideas that are equitable- works best for usrs
- Let users test the idea and they might find the best ideas.

####  Understanding the business needs behind a design
Design can help facilitate a conversation between a business and its users.
- Voice and tone have a huge impact on a user's experience with a product
- Keep in mind the fundamentals of driving sales when designing.
- it's helpful to research your brand's competitors as part of the design exploration.

### how to use findings from your competitive audit to brainstorm new ideas?
Your goal is to walk away from this brainstorm with a list of ideas that help your product stand out from the competition.
