# Ideating Design Solutions

### Understand design ideation
- **Design ideation** is the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic without judging or evaluating them.
##### Preparing for ideation
- Empathize with your user.
- Define the problem.
- Establish a creative environment.
- Set a time limit.
- Assemble a diverse team.
- Think outside the box.

##### Why should we come up with a lot of ideas?

- Let users test the ideas

##### Recognize business needs during design ideation
- Two major components of branding are **voice** and **tone**
- Design can help facilitate a conversation between a business and its users.

### Conduct competitive audit
- A **competitive audit** is an overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses.
- **Direct competitors** are companies that have offerings similar to your product and focus on the same audience.
- **Indirect competitors** can have a similar set of offerings and a different audience, or a different set of offerings with the same audience.

##### Why are competitive audits important?
- Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their designs.
- Suggesting ideas to solve early problems that you’re facing with your own designs.
- Revealing the ways that current products in the market are not meeting users’ needs. This is a gap for your product to address!
- Demonstrating the expected life cycle of a product in the same market as yours.
- Informing all the different iterations your product could take and how those performed for your competitors.
