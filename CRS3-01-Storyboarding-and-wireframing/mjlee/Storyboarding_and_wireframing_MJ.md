#### What to learn this week
1. How to use research findings to inform ideation during the design process.
2. Create two types of storyboards: big picture and close-up. 
3. Explore the benefits of wireframing and raw wireframes.

###  examples of pain points

#### Receiving the same response to three different questions from an automated chatbot
:point_right:  This is an example of a support pain point, since the user can’t get the answers they need. 

#### Completing the checkout process for a food delivery app
:point_right: Review the section that covers user pain points in Course 2: Start the UX Design Process: Empathize, Define, and Ideate.

#### Struggling to interact with a button on a mobile app’s homepage because it’s extremely small
:point_right: This is an example of a product pain point, since it is a usability issue that frustrates the user.

# Use research to inform ideation

#### Empathy maps 
explore users’ four main motivations: what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. 
<br/>Ideas for solutions that address the user’s real problems. 

#### Personas 
place the users who you’re designing for front-and-center. <br/>Envision potential users that you’d design for.

#### User stories 
determine which user needs are the most critical to address with your designs. <br/>focus your ideation.

#### User journeys 
help you come up with ideas for designs that truly support the users’ needs and solve their problems. 

#### A problem statement 
Clear description of the user’s need that should be addressed. 
<br/>Guide the focus of your ideation.

# goal statements
who, what, why, and how is to refer back to your problem statement.
#### + measure effectiveness by its impact

###  transition from the problem the user is facing to the solution
- <b>who</b> can come from the persona. 
- <b>What</b> could come from the user story. 
- <b>Why</b> can come from the empathy map and user journey maps
- <b>how</b> can come from the brainstorming. The how is important because it helps make sure the goal is measurable and realistic.

# Outline user flows
### A user flow is the path taken by a typical user on an app or website so they can complete a task from start to finish.

# Create storyboards

1. Character, is the user in your story. 
2. Scene, helps us imagine the user's environment. 
3. Plot describes the benefit or solution of the design.
4. Narrative describes the user's need or problem and how the design will solve the problem.

### big picture storyboard 
Focused on the how and the why behind the user’s engagement with your design. When creating a big picture storyboard, think about questions like:
- Why does the user need our app? Step 1-3 : background to use the app
- How will the user use app? step 4 : user experience
- Why will the user be delighted by the app? step 5-7 : pain points and user satisfaction

#### A big picture storyboard should meet the following guidelines:
- focus on the user.
- indicate the environment or context where the user is located.
- focus on the specific need or pain point experienced by the user.

### The close-up storyboard 
Less about emotion since the close-up storyboard is focused on the practical aspects of the design itself.
- What happens on each screen of the product?
- What does the user do to transition from one screen to another?
- What are some assumptions we are making about this experience?
- What are some potentially complicated interactions or pain points that will need to be addressed?


#### A close-up storyboard should meet the following guidelines:
- focus on the product instead of on the user experiencing that product.
- indicate the interaction that a user may have with the product by depicting sample screens.
- indicate any transitions between screens or states that the user may need to perform.
