# Joining Design Sprints
### Five phases of design sprints
##### 1. Understand
- sets your sprint on the right track and helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge
- takes time to learn from experts and engage in creative discussions with a lot of different people from other departments and industries.
##### 2. Ideate
- starts this phase by coming up with ideas and building off of them to create solutions.
- takes time to sketch and present their ideas.
- needs to start planning for user testing
##### 3. Decide
- decides on the one solution that is most likely to excite users and increase sales.
##### 4. Prototype
- builds the first version of your new app feature.
- finishes prepping for user testing by confirming the test schedule, finalizing interview questions, and making sure your prototype is good to go.
##### 5. Test
- puts your prototype in front of users.
- gains critical insight about changes that need to be made before you launch the new feature.

### Plan design sprints
##### Steps
- User research
- Call in the experts
- Find the right space
- Gather supplies
- Establish sprint rules
- Plan introductions
- Post-sprint planning

##### The design sprint brief
- A document that you share with all your attendees to help them prepare for the sprint.

### Participate in design sprints
##### An entry-level designer’s role in a sprint
- Phase 1: Make note of any thoughts you have.
- Phase 2: Coming up with ideas and putting them out there.
- Phase 3: Vote for the one you think has the most potential. Help by scheduling testers, creating survey or interview questions, and gathering necessary equipment.
- Phase 4: Be actively involved in creating a solid prototype for users to try out.
- Phase 5: Be asked to collect user feedback by observing and interviewing users.

### Reflect on design sprints
##### Common retrospective questions
- 1. What went well?
  - Which tools saved you the most time and effort?
  - When did you feel the most satisfaction?
  - What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?
- 2. What can be improved?
  - What went wrong that caught you off guard?
  - Which problems came up the most often?
  - When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?
  - Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design?
  - Did an external factor derail your productivity?
  - And most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem?
- Lessons learned
  - What did you discover during the sprint that you’re still wondering about?
  - How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions?
