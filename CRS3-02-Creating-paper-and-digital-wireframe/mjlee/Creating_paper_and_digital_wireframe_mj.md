3. Common region

4. Focal point
5. Continuity
6. Closure
7. Figure-ground


EXAMPLES
### #1. <B>Similarity</B> : when things appear to be similar to each other, we group them together. And we also tend to think they have the same function. 
#### Distinguish different sections. 
###### ex: 
Title: 40px Regular
<BR/>Body text: 20px Regular
<BR/>Text Icon link: 20px Bold

### #2. <B>Proximity</B> : close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart. 
####  it overrides similarity of color, shape, and other factors that might differentiate a group of objects.
##### ex:

### #3. <B>common region</B> : when objects are located within the same closed region, we perceive them as being grouped together.

### #4. Focal point: Areas of interest, emphasis or difference within a composition that capture and hold the viewer’s attention
#####  whatever stands out visually will capture and hold the viewer’s attention first.

### #5. Continuity:  elements that are arranged on a line or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on the line or curve.
##### ex: Amazon uses continuity to communicate that each of the products below is similar and related to each other (books of similar topics that are available for purchase).

### #6. Closure : when you see an image that has missing parts, your brain will fill in the blanks and make a complete image so you can still recognize the pattern.

### #7. Figure-ground: people instinctively perceive objects as either being in the foreground or the background.
