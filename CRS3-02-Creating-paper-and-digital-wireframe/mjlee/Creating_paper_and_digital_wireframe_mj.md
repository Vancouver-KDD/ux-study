# Gestalt principles and examples
##### in wireframes 
1. Similarity
2. Proximity
3. Common region

##### more
4. Figure-ground
5. Continuity
6. Closure
7. Focal point


EXAMPLES
### #1. <B>Similarity</B> : when things appear to be similar to each other, we group them together. And we also tend to think they have the same function. 
#### Distinguish different sections. 
###### ex: 
Title: 40px Regular
<BR/>Body text: 20px Regular
<BR/>Text Icon link: 20px Bold

#### #2. <B>Proximity</B> : close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart. 
####  it overrides similarity of color, shape, and other factors that might differentiate a group of objects.
##### ex:

#### #3. <B>common region</B> : when objects are located within the same closed region, we perceive them as being grouped together. 

##### ex:  we used box border to enclose all the features to their respective category, so that they will be seen as one instead of individual elements. And below is the implementation:
