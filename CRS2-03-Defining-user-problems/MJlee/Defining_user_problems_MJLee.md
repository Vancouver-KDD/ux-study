# Define problem and hypothesis statements


## Problem statement
A clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed.
### The 5 Ws and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how
- <b> Who</b> is experiencing the problem? To create successful solutions for users.

- <b> What</b> are the pain points to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.

- <b> Where</b> is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.

- <b> When</b> does the problem occur? To help you better empathize with the user’s feelings. 

- <b> Why</b> is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.

- <b> How</b> are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

## Define hypothesis statements
Hypothesis statements don't have a standard formula, so be flexible and adapt to end up with the best design solution.
- Empathizing with users allows you to consider the product experience from the users’ perspective. 
- Define the problem they're facing.

## Create a value proposition

##### - What does your product do?
##### - why should the user care?

### Build value propositions
1. Gather all the great features and benefits
2. Categorize values and line up
3. Official value proposition list which is connect these features and benefits with the needs of your users
4. Review and compare with competitors and remove the redudant features and pick the unique benefits

### They need to be short, clear, and to the point. 
- Users want to be able to easily identify exactly how your product will meet their unique needs and what sets your product apart in the market. 
- Sometimes users won’t know what they need until you explain it to them. That’s the real heart of product design innovation.
