# Define problem and hypothesis statements

## Problem statement
A clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed.
### The 5 Ws and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how
- <b> Who</b> is experiencing the problem? To create successful solutions for users.

- <b> What</b> are the pain points to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.

- <b> Where</b> is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.

- <b> When</b> does the problem occur? To help you better empathize with the user’s feelings. 

- <b> Why</b> is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.

- <b> How</b> are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.
