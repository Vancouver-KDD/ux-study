### Understand ethical and inclusive design

  - UX methods that trick users into doing or buying something they wouldn't otherwise have done or bought.

- Forced continuity
  - The practice of charging a user for a membership without a warning or a reminder.
- Sneak into basket
  - When a user has to remove an item from their cart if they don’t want to buy it, which is an extra step that could be easily missed.
- Hidden costs
  - Hidden or unexpected charges in the user’s cart that are not revealed until the end of the checkout process.
- Confirmshaming
  - When users are made to feel guilty when they opt out of something.
- Urgency
  - Attempting to convince users to purchase an item before they run out of time and miss today’s “amazing” price.
- Scarcity
  - When a website makes users very aware of the limited number of items in stock.

###### What can you do to avoid deceptive patterns?
In your role as a new UX designer, you can help prevent deceptive patterns by being aware of them. That way, when you see a deceptive pattern in action, you’ll be able to correct them. Remember, deceptive patterns are unethical and should be avoided. Being clear and honest with your users will strengthen their trust in your brand and product.

##### Explore the effects of designs that deceive
- Dopamine
  - A natural chemical in the brain that's released when something pleasurable happens that makes us feel good or intrigued.

##### Understand the attention economy
As a UX designer, the product you create will constantly compete for users’ attention. If users are paying attention to one thing, like a notification on their mobile phone, it means they’re ignoring something else. There are only 24 hours in a day, so users have to be selective about how they spend that time! This battle over users’ attention is referred to as the **attention economy**.
- Avoid deceptive patterns.
- Think about goals and metrics.
- Share good design practices with the people you work with.

##### Understand your impact as a UX designer
**Ethical design** is about understanding how your design work affects the world.
- A **dominant culture** affects the values or norms that are important for other cultures.
- A **marginalized population** is one where people experience discrimination or exclusion from mainstream society because of specific characteristics or life experiences that are wrongfully deemed as inferior.
- **Underrepresented populations** are groups of people whose values and experiences aren’t represented often enough in a society that’s shaped by the dominant culture and their point of view.
- **Edge cases** are situations that a user experiences with a product that the designers didn’t prepare for.
- **Inclusive design** means making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like ability, race, economic status, language, age, and gender.
- **Accountability**. One way to help make sure that your product designs are inclusive for all users is to be held accountable by the people you work with and the users you’re designing for.
- **Design ethically**
  - Create inclusive personas
  - Broaden your definition of “stakeholder”
