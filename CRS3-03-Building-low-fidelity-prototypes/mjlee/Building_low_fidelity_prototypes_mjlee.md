# Understand ethical and inclusive design

## implicit bias in design

UX designers need to be aware of how our own points of view can alter our designs, influence users and affect society.
### Implicit biases are the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge. 
Being aware of your implicit biases and combating stereotypes is important work. By creating inclusive user experiences, designers help build a more equitable society.

## deceptive patterns. Avoid them!

### Forced continuity:
- Notify users before their free trial ends and before they are charged. 
- Make it easy for users to cancel their membership. Don’t make users search for the steps to cancel.
- Provide a link to take users through the cancellation process. 
- Make sure the visual elements in your designs, like buttons, are labeled clearly.

### Sneak into basket: 
-  no boxes are pre-selected that add items to a user’s cart. 

### Hidden costs: 
-  give users all pricing related information upfront. (calculate extra costs, like shipping and taxes, before checking out. )

### Confirmshaming: 

-avoid manipulating (attempting to make them feel guilty about their choice)  the emotions of your users. 

### Urgency
-  aren't using this deceptive pattern to manipulate your users into making sales quickly.

### Scarcity 
: very aware of the limited number of items in stock.

- Designers should always aim to inform and not deceive users.

#####  :warning: Avoid deceptive patterns. 
Be honest with users. Think about your purpose for design and how your own values align with the design. 

##### :dart: Think about goals and metrics. 
Understand your company’s business goals and key performance indicators. Pay attention to how these business goals might contradict or align with your users’ goals.

##### :princess: Share good design practices with the people you work with. 
Understand your position of power as a UX designer. You have the ability to influence the decision-making process for good and make sure that the right design choices are being made.


## Ethical design
#### dominant culture
one of your users has that opposite perspective.
#### marginalized population (소외) & Underrepresented populations (과소)
Both marginalized and underrepresented populations aren’t part of the dominant culture, so they’re often not recognized in the design process unless the designer makes a conscious decision to include them. 

- How can I design products so that the dominant culture is not always viewed as the norm? 

- How can I design products in a way that encourages all perspectives to be included?

#### Edge cases 
are situations that a user experiences with a product that the designers didn’t prepare for.
####### Be flexible and ready to adjust your designs throughout the process to account for these kinds of unexpected issues among groups of users that you might not have initially considered. 

#### Inclusive design 
In inclusive design, there is no such thing as normal, and there is no "average" person to design for.

#### Accountability
 Seek out the opinions of users, coworkers, and stakeholders who are different from you. 
 
### 01.Create inclusive personas
### 02.Broaden your definition of “stakeholder”
### 03.Increase collaboration
