# Understand ethical and inclusive design

## implicit bias in design

UX designers need to be aware of how our own points of view can alter our designs, influence users and affect society.
### Implicit biases are the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge. 
Being aware of your implicit biases and combating stereotypes is important work. By creating inclusive user experiences, designers help build a more equitable society. 

## deceptive patterns. Avoid them!

### Forced continuity:
- Notify users before their free trial ends and before they are charged. 
- Make it easy for users to cancel their membership. Don’t make users search for the steps to cancel.
- Provide a link to take users through the cancellation process. 
- Make sure the visual elements in your designs, like buttons, are labeled clearly.

### Sneak into basket: 
-  no boxes are pre-selected that add items to a user’s cart. 

### Hidden costs: 
-  give users all pricing related information upfront. (calculate extra costs, like shipping and taxes, before checking out. )

### Confirmshaming: 

-avoid manipulating (attempting to make them feel guilty about their choice)  the emotions of your users. 

### Urgency
-  aren't using this deceptive pattern to manipulate your users into making sales quickly.

### Scarcity 
: very aware of the limited number of items in stock.

- Designers should always aim to inform and not deceive users.
