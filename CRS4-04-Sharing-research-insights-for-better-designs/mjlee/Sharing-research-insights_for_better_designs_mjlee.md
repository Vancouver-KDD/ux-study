### priorize and itherate
UX design is a really iterative process, <br/>
very often prioritizing and advocating for user needs becomes the responsibility of the UX designer.

##### We learned the linear method: 
     * research -> wireframe > progotype > userbility testing > insight -> design 

##### However, in reality, it's circular. 

     *  researching > synthesizing > iterating based on that research (looping)
 is a loop, not a line. That means the cycle is often repeated many times.
