# Introducing User Experience Design

## Who are UX Designers?

They tend to have various backgrounds or knowledges before they became an UX Designer.<br/>
For example..
  * an artist without a formal design education
  * a technology professional with a curiosity to learn about the magic of UX design
  * etc..

## What is User Experience?
- User Experience : How a person **feels** about *interacting with* *or experiencing* a product.
- Product : A good, service, or feature
  - Video Game controller, potato chip, smart phone, new "Buy" button 

## Four aspects of User Experience we care about
- **Usable** - Improve usability
  - The Design, structure and the purpose of the product should be clear and easy to use, for any people. 
    * Is everything in the design easy to find?
    * Is the design's functionality easy to understand?
    * Can users accomplish specific tasks within the design?

- **Equitable**
  - Helpful to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. 
  - High-quality experience should be delivered to all users regardless of background, gender, race, or ability.

- **Enjoyable**
  - Create positive connection between the users and the products. Taking users' thought and feeling into a count. **It's all about feeling, sympathy**
  - Research comes in to solve this. Ask users, survey, analysis. 
  * Are there aspects of the design that consider the user’s feelings and their thoughts?
  * Does the design inspire delight in the user?
  * Does the design keep the user engaged throughout their experience and make them excited to keep using the product?

- **Useful**
  - Solve user problems. What if the map suddenly doesn't work if you are lost?
  - But **useful** and **usable** are not the same. 
    - Usability refers to the product *working well* and *being easy to use*.
    - Usefulness refers directly to the ability to *solve user problems*.

## What UX Designers do?

Focus on the **experience that users have** while using products like websites, apps, and physical objects. And the end goal is to make those everyday <ins>interactions useful, enjoyable, and accessible</ins>.

UX Designers usually have a good sense of visuals. Images or any visual components. But it is not that necessary. Visual aspect is only a small aspect of UX.

Besides, UX Designers are more curious about people, how they think, and how to make the product easier to use.

## Various UX Designer roles 

* Interaction Designers - Focus on designing the *experience* of a product and how *it functions*.
  * The Goal : Make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.

      >"What should happen if a user taps on this button?"<br/>
      "How do we make this action easier for users to complete?"<br/>
      "How are the design elements within the website laid out?"
    </details><br/>

* Visual Designers - How *a product or technology looks*. Logos, illustrations, icons, font color, size or placement of visual elements. They focus on the layout of each page or screen and make all of the design elements fit together in a visually appealing way.
  * The Goal : To delight users with designs that inspire, engage, and excite them.

      <summary>You would ask yourself...</summary>
      >"What kind of visual style should icons have, in order to fit the product's branding?"<br/>
    "Which color and font should we use for this button?"<br/>
    "How are the design elements within the website laid out?"
    </details><br/>

* Motion designers - What it feels like for *a user to walk through a product* and how to *create smooth transitions between pages* on an app or website.
  * The Goal : Design elements that move, rather than traditional static designs.

      <summary>You would ask yourself...</summary>
      >"How should an app transition between pages?"<br/>
    "How do we show the connection between these actions?"<br/>
    "What’s an engaging animation that will help tell our story?"
    </details><br/>

  <summary>You would work with those people...</summary>

  * UX Researchers - Conduct studies or interviews that examine how people use a product. They will try identifying pain points of while using the product and explore how products can help solve those problems.

  * UX Writer - How to make the language within a product clearer so that the user experience is more intuitive. Also help on defining a brand's voice and personality, tone of language or labels for buttons.

  * UX Engineer - Translate the design's intent into a functioning experience. Help UX Design teams to figure out if designs are intuitive and technically feasible. UX Engineers synthesize design and development, bringing product concepts to life.

## Product development life cycle

![](./images/product-dev-life-cycle.png)
(The success of each stage depends on the previous stage's completion)

1. Brainstorm
  - For a target goal, *explore problems, ideas, feedbacks* by doing user surveys and check the competitors.<br/>
   => It will help determine what problems need to be addressed by the product's design.

2. Define
  - *Narrow down the brainstormed resources* into *the specifications of the product*. Making a **scope** of the product.
    - Who is the product for?
    - What will the product do?
    - What features need to be included for the product to be successful?

    The product cannot solve every user problem. It should focus on a specific problem to solve, not solving all existing problems.

    And defining scope will guide the following process to be goal-oriented and focused.

3. Design  <- The stage that UX designers are most engaged
  - Drawing wireframes (outlines or sketches of the product)
  - Creating prototypes (early model of a product that convey its functionality)

4. Test
  - Work with engineers to develop functional prototypes that match the original designs, bring it into a real life. 

    Includes three stage of testing
    - Internal testing
    - Stakeholder testing : Who will make decisions about the product.
    - External testing with potential users (or beta testing)

5. Launch


## Job Responsibility of Entry-level UX Designers

1. Researching - Understand the people who use our product
    * Backgrounds, demographics, motivations, **pain points**, emotions, and goals.
    * By surveys, observations, and interviews.

2. Wireframing - Basic outline or sketch of a product, or a screen like an app or website
    * Create *wires* with lines and shapes, with some text.
    * Can be drawn by hand or digitally, *bringing the design ideas to life*.

3. Prototyping - Early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality.
    * Tend to make multiple prototypes for any given product throughout the design process.
    * Prototype's scale can vary
      * Could be made to demonstrate one specific feature of a product.
      * ex) transition between screens
      * ex) the way the product physically looks and feels

4. Create Information Architecture (or IA) - Decide how our product is *organized and structured*
    * A **skeleton** that outlines how users interact with our product. 


5. Visual Design - How the product or technology looks

6. Communicate Effectively with other team members


## Growth of UX Designers in their career
